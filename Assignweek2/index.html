        <h3 class ="t1">Fruits</h3>
        <p class = "p1"><br>Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids.
<br>
Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person’s risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. Citrus fruits and berries may be especially powerful for preventing disease.</p>

        <h3 class ="t2">Legumes</h3>
        <p class = "p2"><br>Legumes are the seeds of the plants in the Fabaceae family – a family that includes beans, lentils, soybeans, peas, peanuts, and even alfalfa and clover.<br> <br> They are exceptionally healthy foods for humans and animals, with the added bonus of being excellent for the environment: their roots fix nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need for petroleum-based fertilizers. </p>

        <h3 class ="t3">Mix-Veg</h3>
            <p class = "p3"><br>This North Indian style mixed vegetable curry recipe is a family favorite and my mom’s recipe. It tastes delicious with phulkas, parathas or pooris.
<br><br>
The best part of this mix vegetable curry recipe is that you can use spare veggies that are in your kitchen and make a one pot tasty mix veg gravy.</p>
